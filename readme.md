# Data Pipeline Project

A modular Python data pipeline for extracting, transforming, validating, and loading data from multiple sources, with built-in data quality checks and logging.

---

## Project Overview

This project enables robust data ingestion from APIs, databases, and files, processes data via transformations and validations, then loads it to target destinations such as databases or files. Logging and quality assurance are integral parts of the workflow.

## Project Structure and Descriptions

| File              | Purpose                                                                                     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `from_API.py`     | Extracts data from external APIs, handling API requests and response parsing.               |
| `from_db.py`      | Connects to databases and extracts raw data via SQL queries or stored procedures.           |
| `from_file.py`    | Reads data from local or network files (e.g., CSV, JSON) and loads it into dataframes.      |
| `to_db.py`        | Loads transformed data into target database tables, managing inserts and updates.           |
| `to_file.py`      | Saves processed data into files, supporting formats such as CSV or JSON.                    |
| `transformer.py`  | Implements core transformation logic for cleaning, enriching, and reshaping data.           |
| `add_quality.py`  | Adds quality metrics, flags, or calculated fields to help monitor data health.              |
| `quality_checks.py` | Runs validation routines to verify data integrity, completeness, and conformity.          |
| `logger.py`       | Provides logging utilities to track pipeline progress, errors, and important events.        |

## Key Features

- Flexible multi-source extraction (API, DB, file)  
- Customizable transformation and enrichment functions  
- Automated and configurable data quality checks  
- Versatile data loading to databases or file systems  
- Centralized logging for traceability and debugging  

---

## Installation

Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed. Then install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Sample `requirements.txt`

```
pandas
requests
sqlalchemy
psycopg2-binary
pyyaml
python-dateutil
loguru
pytest
```

Adjust this file based on your actual imports and environment.

## Usage Guide

You can run each part of the pipeline separately or orchestrate them together, for example:

```bash
python from_API.py
python from_db.py
python from_file.py
python transformer.py
python quality_checks.py
python add_quality.py
python to_db.py
python to_file.py
```

### Suggested Workflow

1. Extract data from sources (`from_API.py`, `from_db.py`, `from_file.py`)  
2. Transform data (`transformer.py`)  
3. Validate data quality (`quality_checks.py`)  
4. Add quality flags (`add_quality.py`)  
5. Load data into targets (`to_db.py`, `to_file.py`)  
6. Check logs generated by `logger.py` for success or errors  

---

## Logging

Logging is managed by `logger.py`, which configures log files and console output. Logs include timestamps, severity levels, and messages for easier troubleshooting.

---

## Testing

Use `pytest` or your preferred test framework to run any tests you create for validation or transformation logic.

```bash
pytest tests/
```
